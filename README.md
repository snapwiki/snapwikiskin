# Snap<i>!</i> Wiki Skin

Snap<i>!</i> Wiki Skin is a MediaWiki skin written with Mustache and Vue.JS templates with the Snap<i>!</i> Wiki and Snap<i>!</i> website's layout in mind.

## Credits

This skin has been developed by GrahamSH and R4356th. We would like to thank Snap<i>!</i> website developer <a href="https://github.com/bromagosa">Bernat Romagosa</a> from whose code we shamelessly stole a lot of <a href="https://github.com/snap-cloud/SnapSite/tree/master/static/style">CSS</a>! We would also like to thank <a href="https://github.com/alistair3149">Alistair3149</a> who helped us by pointing us to the relevant MediaWiki documentation! This skin could not exist without their help. <3:heart:
